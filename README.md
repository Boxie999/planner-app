# planner-app
This is a daily planner application.

Functions:
It displays the current day at the top of the page.
There are blocks for each workday hours, from 9am to 5pm.
Each block has a time display, an input field and a save button.
Based on the current time, the blocks in the past are grey, the one in the present is red,
and the ones in the future are green.
If the user types something in the input field and clicks the save button, it saves the data and the time into the local storage.
Even after refreshing the page and putting new data into the local storage, it displays the previous inputs as well, as a string.

Tools that I used:
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, fontawesome, google fonts, moment.js
